# Task 1: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing - Titanic Dataset

## Objective
Clean and preprocess the Titanic dataset for use in ML models.

## Steps Done
- Handled missing values using median/mode.
- Encoded categorical features (`Sex`, `Embarked`).
- Scaled numerical features (`Age`, `Fare`) using StandardScaler.
- Visualized and removed outliers using boxplots and IQR.

## Libraries Used
- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Dataset
[Titanic Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset)

## Output
A clean and ready-to-use dataset for ML tasks.\

# Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (Titanic Dataset)

## Objective
Understand data using visualizations and statistics to identify trends, patterns, and anomalies.

## Key Insights
- Males had lower survival rates than females.
- Passengers in higher classes had higher chances of survival.
- Younger passengers had better survival rates.
- Fare is positively correlated with survival.

## Visuals Used
- Histograms
- Boxplots
- Correlation Matrix
- KDE plots
- Pairplots

## Tools Used
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
